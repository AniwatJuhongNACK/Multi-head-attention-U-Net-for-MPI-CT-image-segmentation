# Multi-head-attention-U-Net-for-MPI-CT-image-segmentation
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging non-invasive molecular imaging modality with high sensitivity and specificity, exceptional linear quantitative ability, and potential for successful applications in clinical settings. Computed tomography (CT) is typically combined with the MPI image to obtain more anatomical information. Herein, we present a deep learning-based approach for MPI-CT image segmentation. The dataset utilized in training the proposed deep learning model was obtained from transgenic mice administered with indocyanine green (ICG)-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoworms (NWs-ICG) as the tracer. The NWs-ICG can progressively accumulate in tumors as a result of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The proposed deep learning model exploits the advantages of the multi-head attention mechanism and the U-Net model to perform segmentation on the MPI-CT images showing superb results. In addition, we characterized the model with a different number of attention heads to explore the optimal number for our custom MPI-CT dataset
